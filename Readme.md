## Description

_Pierre was so pleased with your console app for his bakery that he wants to hire you for a new project. An application to keep track of delivieries.

In all seriousness this is an application to demonstrate the proficiency with using all skills I learned this week such as MVC applications, Razor, Objects within Objects, using static content, CRUD meathods, & RESTFUL Routing._
